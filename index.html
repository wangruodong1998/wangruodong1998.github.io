        <h2>Never say ......</h2>
        <h2>I have never heard of your faith</h2>
        <h2>Nor your evil spirit and cunning<h2>
        <h2>Ugly and ridiculous self - redemption<h2>
        <h2>But like a mask of the Virgin<h2>
        <h2>Under the frosted pupil<h2>
        <h2>What you see is the warm sun<h2>
        <h2>I fiddle with my guitar very stubbornly<h2>
        <h2>Want to play to you, like with you<h2>
        <h2>As the seasons pass, you become silent<h2>
        <h2>Finally the string breaks and the sun sets<h2>
        <h2The seasons stop and all is quiet><h2>
